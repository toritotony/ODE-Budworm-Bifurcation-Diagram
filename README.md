# ODE-Budworm-Bifurcation-Diagram
A repository that allows you to generate two bifurcation diagrams (2D and 3D versions) of the budworm population model, which is an adjusted version of the logistic population model. More information below which describes how we arrive at the equations that describe the bifurcation values in terms of the growth rate and maximum capacity. Keep in mind that we start by expressing our desire to search for equilibrium values by setting our ODE to zero.

Consider the budworm model given by
\begin{equation}
\frac{dP}{dt} = rP\left(1-\frac{P}{N}\right) - \frac{P^2}{1+P^2},
\end{equation}
where \(r\) is the intrinsic growth rate and \(N\) is the carrying capacity.

\textbf{Step 1. Finding the Equilibria}

For an equilibrium, we set \(\frac{dP}{dt} = 0\). For \(P>0\) we can divide by \(P\) (since \(P=0\) is the trivial equilibrium) to obtain:
\begin{equation}
r\left(1-\frac{P}{N}\right) = \frac{P}{1+P^2}.
\end{equation}

\textbf{Step 2. The Bifurcation (Saddle--Node) Condition}

A saddle--node bifurcation occurs when two equilibria merge. In addition to the equilibrium condition above, we require that the derivative with respect to \(P\) is zero. That is, if we define
\[
F(P) = r\left(1-\frac{P}{N}\right) - \frac{P}{1+P^2},
\]
then at the bifurcation point we need:
\[
F(P)=0 \quad \text{and} \quad F'(P)=0.
\]

Without going into all the algebraic details, one can show that these conditions lead to the following parametric relations (with \(P>1\) to ensure positivity of \(N\)):
\begin{equation}
N = \frac{2P^3}{P^2-1}, \quad \text{and} \quad r = \frac{2P^3}{(1+P^2)^2}.
\end{equation}

\textbf{Step 3. Interpretation}

These relations mean that for any equilibrium value \(P>1\), the corresponding values of \(r\) and \(N\) at which the bifurcation occurs are given by the formulas above. Notably, as \(N\) becomes very large (which happens when \(P\) is very close to 1), the expression for \(r\) approaches
\[
r \approx \frac{2\cdot 1^3}{(1+1)^2} = \frac{2}{4} = 0.5.
\]
Thus, in the limit of a large carrying capacity, the bifurcation occurs at \(r\approx 0.5\).

This derivation underlies the 2D and 3D bifurcation diagrams generated by the scripts, illustrating how the parameters \(r\), \(N\), and the equilibrium \(P\) are interrelated.

**Budworm Model Bifurcation Analysis**

Consider the budworm model given by

$$
\frac{dP}{dt} = rP\left(1-\frac{P}{N}\right) - \frac{P^2}{1+P^2},
$$

where \(r\) is the intrinsic growth rate and \(N\) is the carrying capacity.

### 1. Finding the Equilibria

To find the equilibria, we set \(\frac{dP}{dt} = 0\). For \(P > 0\) (ignoring the trivial equilibrium \(P=0\)), we can divide by \(P\) to obtain:
 
$$
r\left(1-\frac{P}{N}\right) = \frac{P}{1+P^2}.
$$

### 2. Saddle–Node Bifurcation Condition

A saddle–node bifurcation occurs when two equilibria merge. In addition to the equilibrium condition, we require that the derivative with respect to \(P\) vanishes:

$$
\frac{d}{dP}\left[r\left(1-\frac{P}{N}\right)-\frac{P}{1+P^2}\right] = 0.
$$

A simplified derivation shows that these conditions lead to the parametric relations (with \(P > 1\) to ensure \(N>0\)):

$$
N = \frac{2P^3}{P^2-1}, \quad \text{and} \quad r = \frac{2P^3}{(1+P^2)^2}.
$$

### 3. Interpretation

Notice that as \(N\) becomes very large, the expression for \(N\)

$$
N = \frac{2P^3}{P^2-1}
$$

forces \(P\) to be very close to 1 (since for \(P \to 1^+\), \(N \to \infty\)). Substituting \(P \approx 1\) into the formula for \(r\) gives:

$$
r \approx \frac{2\cdot1^3}{(1+1)^2} = \frac{2}{4} = 0.5.
$$

Thus, in the limit of a large carrying capacity, the bifurcation occurs at \(r \approx 0.5\).
